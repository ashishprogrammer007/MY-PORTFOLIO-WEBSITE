            <pre class="introtxt">Hello viewers, I am Ashish Sharma, a Web Developer. I am 19yrs old. I belong to Ajnoli
village of district Una(HP),India. My Father is into the transport services and my Mother
is a housewife.I have done my schooling from GSSS Samoor Kalan. I am currently pursuing
my graduation in Bachelor's of Computer Applications from Government P.G. College Una.
From childhood, I was the guy who loves to use computers. So after my 12<sup>th</sup> 
I opted for this course. I have learnt from the best teachers and classmates
(juniors as well as seniors) throughout my journey. I further want to grow myself more
into the Development field and In future maybe I will also go in Android Development. 
My overall objective is to make myself more prodcutive with time. That's all my intro.
Thanks for visiting my website(i.e. my first project).

As you know this is my 1st project, so at some points I am lacking behind. If you want 
to give feedback about this project, you can simply send it via email or let me know
through call.

This is my 1st project, now I am going to share some details about this project.
This website project is multipaged which means I have used multiple HTML documents
and merged them into index.html file. I have used a static background in this project 
over which I used mutiple DIVS to create containers and add text and images into it.
I do have used mutiple icons in this project. I also used DROP SHADOW at some objects.
I gave them different fonts also.So I started developing this project on 26-December-2022
under guidance of my teacher <a href="" class="mamli" title="To her LinkedIn Profile">Mrs. Monika(Web Developer) </a>and till now its under development.
In future I will be adding some .JS Concepts into it to add animation and functioning 
logics into it.
Thanks

Regards
Ashish Sharma
